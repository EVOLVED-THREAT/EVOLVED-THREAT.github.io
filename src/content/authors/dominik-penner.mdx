bio: |
  I specialize in application security and infrastructure security. I have helped a wide variety of organizations secure their systems over the course of approximately 12 years. Some of these include Internet Service Providers, Electronic Medical Software vendors and Open Source Software vendors.

  Professionally, I've worked as a Senior Security Consultant and Manager at NCC Group, where I tech led many engagements, assisted my reports in reaching their goals and promotions, and provided scoping support to our Solutions Architecture team. I've had the opportunity to tackle a wide variety of challenges, aiming to fully understand a client's needs. My main focus is to report critical vulnerabilities in software before malicious adversaries have the opportunity to exploit them.

    description: "Breaches today are more frequently occurring due to stolen or leaked credentials. The facilitation of API development across teams with platforms such as Postman and SwaggerHub has unleashed new concerns and measures required to ensure the safekeeping of credentials, be it API tokens or passwords. While most research and tooling in this area has been focused towards GitHub, it has been shown that this habit has been brought over to other platforms."
